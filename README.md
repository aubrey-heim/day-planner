## About the Project
This project is the fifth homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I was asked to create a day planner which contains time blocks for standard business hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). I was given a set of acceptance criteria, as well as a gif of an example planner (included below). I was also provided with completed CSS file and the beginnings of an HTML file. The acceptance criteria for this project included the end user being able to input and save text within each of the time blocks, that would persist past a page refresh. The page also needed to include the current date. Additionally, each of the time blocks shown on the page needed to be color coded based on whether they were in the past, present, or future. These last two criteria were to be accomplished through the use of Moment.js.

## Benefits of This Project
This project has given me the opportunity to develop my skills with utilizing local storage on my device. Additionally, I was able to explore the ability to use external libraries to have dynamically updated content. 
An additional unexpected benefit of this project is that I was given the opportunity to experience what it is like to work alongside a fellow coder. I was given a completed CSS sheet, which included the classes which would need to be included in my HTML file. I needed to look at what I was given, and do my best to determine what was intended with the given code. 

## Accessing the Project
The HTML and CSS files are included in this repository for review.
